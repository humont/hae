    The name ‘Hare and Edelweiss’ is drawn from two of our favourite things:
  </div>
  <div class="mv4 n">
    the magical elements ascribed to hares and their role in many of our childhood stories; and the song ‘Edelweiss’ from the film ‘The Sound of Music’, another cherished childhood memory of rainy Sundays spent flinging ourselves around the sitting room as we re-enacted the movie from beginning to end.
  </div>
   <div class="mv4 mb6 n">
     As Hare and Edelweiss is a family business, our influences come from attics filled with artefacts from our Grandparents travels, parents’ childhood stories of youthful years spent in Asia and Africa, and our own coastal British upbringing, fuelled by soggy picnics and lukewarm flasks of tea. We have been brought up with a deep love and respect of nature, and encouraged to see the extraordinary beauty in the everyday. All of these elements intertwine in our designs, and we endeavour to make items of distinction that will be cherished by other families for generations.
