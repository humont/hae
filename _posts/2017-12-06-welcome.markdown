What a busy month we have had! Thank you all so much for your continued patience and support as we have been working hard to build our website. This month has seen us launch a completely new brand identity and we are so excited you have all decided to come on this journey with us. With the temperatures dropping and the leaves beginning to turn we have started work on more of our ‘cosy’ designs, perfect for snuggling up on chilly evenings in front of a roaring log fire. We have been drawing on our soft tartan fleeces from last year and thinking about which fabrics really provide a sumptuous softness as you sink into them. We also cracked open a chest of vintage materials from our attic and have been developing a ‘heritage’ off-the-peg range that will be available on the website soon. Featuring deep-pile velvets and silky satins, this range will include the same delicate stitch-work with a carefully considered patchwork of fabrics and playful accents. We have also been filling up our Christmas commissions list and it is almost full; please place your orders soon in order to avoid disappointment!
