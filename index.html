  <p class="pv4"><span class="xl_m l"><b class="fw7 bg-set" data-background-color="#fff2fa">Jennie</b> has been creating magical illustrations for her family for over three decades.</span> Her eye for detail and ’magic’ touch have evolved through beautifully decorated children’s nurseries and bedrooms to masterfully illustrated, personalised story books for her own children. As Jennie’s artistic capabilities were recognised, friends and family began to commission her for sketches and paintings of much-loved pets, and for the beautifully painted furniture she had become renowned for.  <span class="bg-set" data-background-color="#fff2fa"></span>Never one to rest on her laurels, Jennie has immersed herself in designing intricate and charming motifs for our commissions which delight and enchant in equal measure.</p>
