intro: >-
  At Hare and Edelweiss, we create bespoke and luxury items to the highest
  standards, using only the finest materials and produced entirely in the United
  Kingdom.


  We are a family company and share a love of unique design and timeless
  materials. Our influences come from attics filled with artefacts from our
  Grandparents’ travels, parents’ childhood stories of youthful years spent in
  Asia and Africa, and our own coastal British upbringing, fuelled by soggy
  picnics and steaming flasks of tea. 


  We have been brought up with a deep love and respect of nature, and encouraged
  to see the extraordinary beauty in the everyday. All of these elements
  intertwine in our designs, and we endeavour to make items of distinction that
  will be cherished by other families for generations.
